## âœ¨ Features

- Removes all comment nodes from the current buffer
- Tree-sitter powered: works reliably across languages
- Fast and minimal
- Works with many filetypes (JS, TS, Lua, HTML, Python, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Why?

Sometimes you work on projects generated by LLMs, and the code ends up full of messy, useless comments everywhere.
Recently, I faced this problem and decided to write this plugin to quickly clean them up.
It will be useful for other developers too, because messy comments make code harder to read and maintain.
